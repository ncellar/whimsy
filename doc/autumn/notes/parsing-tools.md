# List of Interesting Parsing Tools

**Disclaimer**: This list is biased. First, towards towards JVM
 languages, and of course, towards work I'm familiar with and find significant.

## "PEG" Combinator libraries

PEG is quoted here because these libraries typically go beyond the [PEG formalism](peg.md) and allow
writing custom combinators.

- [Autumn]: By yours truly. [It's the best, beats the rest!](../faq/why.md) (*coughs*)

- [scala-parser-combinators]: The original Scala parser combinator library. Slow, according to most
  reports.

- [fastparse]: A fast Scala parser combinator library.

- [Papa Carlo]: A Scala combinator library with support for incremental parsing.

- [parboiled2]: A fast Scala parser combinator library.

- [parboiled]: A popular Java/Scala parser combinator library.

- [Mouse]: A very simple simple Java parser combinator library. Clean code and great for
  learning the basics.

- [PEG.js]: Seems to be the most popular Javascript PEG library.

- [ohm]: A Javascript combinator library with a neat [interactive editor]. It is a descendant of
  [OMeta], the first parsing tool to support left-recursion in PEGs.

  [interactive editor]: https://ohmlang.github.io/editor/

- [Bennu]: A Javascript combinator with a lot of gusto.
  "Non-Stop Erotic Javascript Combinatory Parsing" and a heron logo. Yes!
  
- [lpeg]: A popular Lua parser combinator library.

- [nom]: A Rust byte-oriented combinator library. Close to the metal, and probably the fastest
  library on this list.
  
- [parsec]: The first popular parser combinator library, which predates the introduction of PEGs.
  (The idea of parser combinators itself is even much older.) Written in Haskell.
  
- [attoparsec]: A Haskell parser combinator libraries that drops some of parsec's niceties
  (error messages, monad transformer, genericity) in exchange for improved performance and
  incremental parsing ([comparison here]).
  
  [comparison here]: http://stackoverflow.com/a/19213247/298664
  
- [parsimonious]: A Python parser combinator library.

- [TatSu]: A python parser combinator library, with support for left-recursion
  and the cut operator.

- [PetitParser]: A Smalltalk combinator library. Java and Dart versions [also available].

## GLL Combinator Library

- [gll-combinators]: The original GLL combinator library.

- [packrattle]: Polished Javascript GLL combinator library.

- [Meerkat]: A GLL combinator library with data-dependent capabilities
  (a form of context-sensitive parsing) which are notably used to provide disambiguation filters,
  and some other capabilities to ease common parsing pain points.

## Parser Generators

- [ANTLR4]: The star of parser generators. Uses Context Free Grammars (CFG). Emits
  Java, C#, Python2|3, JavaScript, Go, C++ and Swift.
  
- [Rats!]: A fast PEG parser generator that performs many optimizations.

- [peg/leg]: A C PEG parser generator.

- [Canopy]: A Javascript PEG parser generators that can emit Javascript, Java, Ruby or Python.

- [waxeye]: A Racket PEG parser generators. Emits C, Java, Javascript, Python, Ruby and Scheme.

- [parsequery]: A scala library that looks like a combinator library, but uses [Lightweight Modular
  Staging] (LMS) behind the scenes to partially evaluate the parser and get a performance increase
  through the elimination of [megamorphic call sites]. Emits Scala.
  
  [Lightweight Modular Staging]: https://scala-lms.github.io/
  [megamorphic call sites]: TODO

- [nearley.js]: A Javascript CFG parser generator using the Earley algorithm. Has a fancy online
 [visualization tool].

[nearley.js]: http://nearley.js.org/
[visualization tool]: https://omrelli.ug/nearley-playground/

## Other

- [Colm]: Actually a language for tree operations, with parsing capabilities. The only other
  system besides Autumn which can handle context-sensitivity safely. Currently being worked into
  a system targeting computer networking.
  
- [DCG]: Definite Clause Grammars is a language feature of logic languages such as Prolog and
  Mercury that enables defining grammars. It is very close to PEG, but integrated within the
  language, and enables context-sensitive parsing.
